#Save the user input options you allow, e.g., in a set that you can check against when your user makes a choice.
#Create an inventory for your player, where they can add and remove items.
#Players should be able to collect items they find in rooms and add them to their inventory.
#If they lose a fight against the dragon, then they should lose their inventory items.
#Add more rooms to your game and allow your player to explore.
#Some rooms can be empty, others can contain items, and yet others can contain an opponent.
#Implement some logic that decides whether or not your player can beat the opponent depending on what items they have in their inventory
#Use the random module to add a multiplier to your battles, similar to a dice roll in a real game. This pseudo-random element can have an effect on whether your player wins or loses when battling an opponent.
